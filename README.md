# Daily Design Patterns
This repository is created to track my current learning process of the book "The Daily Design Pattern" by Matthew P Jones. Check out [his repo](https://github.com/exceptionnotfound/DesignPatterns) for explanation and more examples.

This is a highly recommended book based on ["Design Patterns (Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software)" by the Gang of Four](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8), but the examples is written in C# and I would like to transform it to Java.
